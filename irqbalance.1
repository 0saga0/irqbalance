.SH NAME
irqbalance \- distribute hardware interrupts across processors on a multiprocessor system
.SH "SYNOPSIS"

.nf
\fBirqbalance\fR 
.fi

.SH "DESCRIPTION"

.PP
The purpose of \fBirqbalance\fR is distribute hardware interrupts across processors on a multiprocessor system in order to increase performance\&.

.SH "OPTIONS"

.TP
.B --oneshot
Causes irqbalance to be run once, after which the daemon exits
.TP

.B --debug
Causes irqbalance to run in the foreground and extra debug information to be printed

.TP
.B --hintpolicy=[exact | subset | ignore]
Set the policy for how irq kernel affinity hinting is treated.  Can be one of:
.P
.I exact
irq affinity hint is applied unilaterally and never violated
.P
.I subset
irq is balanced, but the assigned object will be a subset of the affintiy hint
.P
.I ignore
irq affinity hint value is completely ignored

.TP
.B --powerthresh=<threshold>
Set the threshold at which we attempt to move a cpu into powersave mode
If more than <threshold> cpus are more than 1 standard deviation below the
average cpu softirq workload, and no cpus are more than 1 standard deviation
above (and have more than 1 irq assigned to them), attempt to place 1 cpu in
powersave mode.  In powersave mode, a cpu will not have any irqs balanced to it,
in an effort to prevent that cpu from waking up without need.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"
.TP
.B IRQBALANCE_ONESHOT
Same as --oneshot

.TP
.B IRQBALANCE_DEBUG
Same as --debug

.TP
.B IRQBALANCE_BANNED_CPUS
Provides a mask of cpus which irqbalance should ignore and never assign interrupts to

.TP
.B IRQBALANCE_BANNED_INTERRUPTS
A list of space delimited IRQ numbers that irqbalance should not touch
