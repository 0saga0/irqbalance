What is Irqbalance

Irqbalance is a daemon to help balance the cpu load generated by interrupts
across all of a systems cpus.  Irqbalance identifies the highest volume
interrupt sources, and isolates them to a single unique cpu, so that load is
spread as much as possible over an entire processor set, while minimizing cache
hit rates for irq handlers.

Building and Installing
./autogen.sh
./configure [options]
make
make install


Developing Irqbalance
Irqbalance is currently hosted on github, and so developers are welcome to use
the issue/pull request/etc infrastructure found there.  However, most
development discussions take place on the irqbalance mailing list, which can be
subscribed to at:
http://lists.infradead.org/mailman/listinfo/irqbalance

New Developers are encouraged to use this mailing list to discuss ideas and
propose patches.
